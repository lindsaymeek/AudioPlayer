# AudioPlayer
This project uses an LPC213x to implement a simple digital audio player, capable of playing music tracks from a removable flash card

The player is controlled using the component-bus interface from a car audio head-end unit, and provides a line out stereo signal, 
suitable for plugging into the auxiliary input connector of the head-end unit.
